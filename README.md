# hw3

### setup<br> 
- uLCD : tx <-> D1, rx <-> D0, reset <-> D2.<br>
- use "sudo screen /dev/ttyACM*" to open screen on terminal.
- LED1 indicates Gesture_UI mode.
- LED2 indicates Tilt_Detection mode.
- LED3 indicates Initialize gravity vector or not.

### Gesture_UI mode : <br>
- Use "/Gesture_UI/run 1" to start the Gesture_UI mode.<br>
- You will see LED1 to be turned on.
- This UI has four Threshold angle : 25, 30, 35, 40.<br>
- Use "Ring" gesture to select up and use "down" gesture to select down.<br>
- Current mode will both show on the uLCD and terminal.<br>
- Press the "USER_BUTTON" to confirm the Threshold Angle, and you will see your selection on screen.<br>
- Published message will received by python and python will send "/Gesture_UI/run 0" to stop the Gesture_UI mode.<br>
- Then system go back to RPC loop and LED1 turn off.<br>

### Tilt_Detection mode : <br>
- Use "/Tilt_Detection/run 1" to start the Tilt_Detection mode.<br>
- You will see LED2 and LED3 both to be turned on.<br>
- Please put your mbed board on the table, then press the "USER_BUTTON" to complete initialization of gravity vector, then LED3 turn off.<br>
- You can start to tilt the mbed board arbitrarily, the current tilt angle will show on uLCD.<br>
- If current angle is greater than threshold angle, PC will show the event on screen and python will receive the evevt(my detect period is 500ms).<br>
- After 10 times of events, python will send the command to stop this mode and back to RPC loop.<br>

### My result : (I just give one example)<br>
- First you will see the setting scene(connecting to wifi).<br>

- Then we start Gesture_UI mode, you will see the current mode both on screen and uLCD.<br>

- Press USER_BUTTON to confirm Threshold angle, you will see your selection on screen and uLCD. Inaddition, python receive message and print it.<br>

- Start tilt detection mode and press USER_BUTTON to initialize gravity vector, and you will see "Initialization completed" on screen.<br>

- Current tilt angle will show on uLCD.<br>

- tilt over threshold angle will publish the evet on screen and python will receive it and print it.<br> 
- When over 10 times, python will send the command to stop this mode.<br>
